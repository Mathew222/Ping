# 🎵 Super Simple Sound Setup (5 Minutes!)

## I Cannot Download Files For You

Unfortunately, I cannot download MP3/MP4 files directly. But I've made it **super easy** for you!

## ⚡ Quickest Method (Recommended)

### Step 1: Run This Script
```powershell
.\download_sounds.ps1
```

This will:
- Open Pixabay in your browser

### Step 2: Download 4 Sounds
1. Click on any notification sound you like
2. Click the "Download" button (it's FREE!)
3. Save to your Downloads folder
4. Repeat 4 times (for 4 different sounds)

### Step 3: Rename & Move
1. Rename the downloaded files to:
   - `gentle_chime.mp3`
   - `classic_bell.mp3`
   - `digital_beep.mp3`
   - `urgent_alert.mp3`

2. Move them to:
   ```
   c:\Users\mathe\Desktop\project\ping\assets\sounds\
   ```

3. Delete the `.txt` placeholder files

### Step 4: Test

But I CAN:
